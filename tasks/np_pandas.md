### Home Task NumPy & Pandas

* NumPy vs Python
    * In previous task you implemented the python program which multiplies matrices using native data types (lists only) [see this](https://github.com/korobool/hlll_course/blob/master/tasks/programming_warm_up.md), take your solution
    * Do the same using NumPy
    * Compare running time (and memory, if possible) on matrix multiplication (especially big size vector)
* Analyse dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic competition with Pandas (files are also [here](./data/titanic))
    * find how many kids (<18 y.o) was on Titanic
    * Compute average age for men and women separately
